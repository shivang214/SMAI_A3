        "5. **Potential Overfitting or Underfitting**: The difference between training and test accuracy could indicate potential overfitting or underfitting. If the training accuracy is significantly higher than the test accuracy, it suggests overfitting, where the model is memorizing the training data without generalizing well to unseen data. Conversely, if both accuracies are low, it could indicate underfitting, where the model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",

Additionally, experimenting with different optimization algorithms or exploring more complex models could also be beneficial."
